Dynamic Web Assignment 3

The goal with this assignment was to use the face tracking to map the circle so that when you moved the circle would follow your nose while changing colors as you move across different areas of the screen. While I had some troubles getting the circle to move when the person would
move, I was using a combination of red and blue, with a selective green value to identify the color. The resource I used for this assignment 
was from the P5.Js examples page which is linked and located in the credits sections of the assignment ( https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-interactivity-2.html ) The only struggle I had with the assignment was centering the circle (video feed) so that it was responsive like the
rest of the page is. In the end I added another circle so that one circle is tracking your nose, and another is tracking your chin. The fun thing I found with this is that the viewer doesnt know whats being tracked so it's like a guessing game of tracking your x coordinates to change the colors.
